# Battleshipps!!!

## Reason

I want to finish my battleship app that I started like ages ago so this is my way of finishing what I started. 
This is something I might put on my resume because the job im at now is losing money and they might put me on their chopping block. rip.
Anyway whats going to happen is im going to make an MVC style app to sharpen my node skills and get my self familiarized with  
structured app development rather than using one single file for one app. This will also walk through my goals and requirements for this
project and maybe help me begin other projects that are bigger and maybe more complicated.

Here are the three versions:

Version 1:
Make a simple battleship app that fights with a random number generator on web

Version 2:
Make the battleship app MVC, then add options such as a database and try and keep score / make a leader board

Version 3: 
Make a full app that can be downloaded on ios or android idk yet. And make it multiplayer
